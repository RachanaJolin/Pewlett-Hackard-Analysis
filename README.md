# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

Number of individuals retiring : 41380. Retirement_info contains the details.
Number of individuals being hired: I believe there was error in the challenge question regarding this- I changed the search criteria to birth year instead of hire date. None of the employees were hired in the range given in the questions
Number of individuals available for mentorship role : 14038. Mentor_Challenge contains the data. 

Another interesting thing to analyze would be the retiring dates per employee. This will help allocate
mentors to train new employees, in a timely fashion.
